I have not officially handed in my notice yet, but my immediate Managers are aware of my intended date subject to my figures. I have had my figures from you in the past, and I have already decided my option choice, but to avoid a problem, I would like to take all my DC pot from Fin Corp 1 and combine it with my DB allowance so as to draw the max tax-free cash sum that I am allowed I would also need to know my Step Pension and the cost of this Step Pension. I have gone on the Fin Corp web site, but I prefer to have a written copy of all my figures. please excuse me if this email is hard to understand as my knowledge of pension jargon is very limited. I am happy for anybody to call or text or email me if I have not explained what I want. I have had conflicting quotations in the past, but I would hope to get as accurate figures as is possible as I am serious about my intention to retire, I have only needed estimates in the past. I have been advised by your office to mention the phrase, I wish to claim my pension, thanking you and look forward to hearing from you.\r\n",

ABC had requested a CETV back in August but did not received anything until late October after he had chased up several times . The CETV was resent with your letter but still retained the original Guarantee date of 21st November ; ABC called to query this and was advised that he could have a 10 day extension ie 1st December .\r\n",

I would mention that unfortunately ABC suffered a heart attack in April and is back in hospital today for another angiogram so we hope that there are no issues which will cause any unnecessary stress . I appreciate your assistance .\r\n",

That leaves just about 6 weeks to take advice from my financial adviser; which he tells me will include further information gathering from Fin Corp, reflect, make a decision, complete and return the necessary documents to Fin Corp.
